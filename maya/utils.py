    Delays the execution of the given script or function until Maya is idle.

    This function runs code using the idle event loop.  This means that the
    main thread must become idle before this python code will be executed.

    There are two different ways to call this function.  The first is to
    supply a single string argument which contains the Python code to execute.
    In that case the code is interpreted.

    The second way to call this routine is to pass it a "callable" object.
    When that is the case, then the remaining regular arguments and keyword
    arguments will be passed to the callable object

    Run commands from the idle queue.

    In general there should be no need to call this method.  It is included here
    as it allows for testing of code that uses the idle events for processing.
    Use this method with caution as will change the behaviour of Maya by
    possibly forcing refreshes or causing other code run before it normally would.
    This may make Maya unrepsonsive.

    This function will return True if all items on the idle queue have been
    processed.  It will return False if only some of the items have been processed.
    There are several cases in which not all items on the idle queue will execute,
    such as when there is an item with exclusive priority.

    This function does not take any arguments.
